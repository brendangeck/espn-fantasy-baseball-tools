# Fantasy Baseball Analyzer Refactoring

## Changes Made

1. **Removed Overly Simple Utility Functions**
   - Removed `get_free_agents()` function from `waiver_utils.py` as it was a simple one-liner
   - Simplified the utility structure to focus on more complex operations

2. **Extracted Waiver Wire Logic**
   - Kept the `find_waiver_replacements()` function from the Waiver Wire Analyzer as the source of truth
   - Maintained the `analyze_post_trade_waiver_options()` function which builds on the replacement logic

3. **Refactored Waiver Wire Analyzer**
   - Added import for `find_waiver_replacements` from `waiver_utils`
   - Replaced the inline waiver replacement logic with a call to the utility function
   - Kept the free agent processing logic in the analyzer since it's specific to the UI workflow

## Benefits of Changes

1. **Improved Code Organization**
   - Complex logic is now properly encapsulated in utility functions
   - UI code focuses on presentation and workflow rather than business logic

2. **Reduced Duplication**
   - Eliminated duplicate waiver replacement logic between files
   - Single source of truth for waiver analysis algorithms

3. **Better Maintainability**
   - Future changes to waiver analysis logic only need to be made in one place
   - Clear separation between UI and business logic

## Next Steps

1. Consider extracting more complex processing logic from the Waiver Wire Analyzer if needed
2. Add unit tests for the utility functions to ensure reliability
3. Document the API of the utility functions for other developers
